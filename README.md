## Course Description

This course examines the fundamentals specific to web development. Topics will include web standards, accessibility/usability, and the markup languages, which serve as the foundation for web development: Hypertext Markup Language 5 (HTML5), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and Extensible Markup Language (XML). 
Students work with these languages at a basic level, learning the essential structures, coding conventions, and best practices associated with the effective use of HTML5 and CSS in modern web-development environments.

Prerequisite: None

## Repository Overview

Carefully read the assigned chapters and narrative I've included under each assignment.

Most assignments have runnable sample code, so you can visually see the concept "in action." 

Approach every week from top-to-bottom and do not move to the next assignment without fully understanding the previous one.
